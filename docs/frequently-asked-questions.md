Once the investigation is finalized, the SHR will take appropriate action or re-rank the player(s) involved. Moreover, SHRs who are conducting investigations have the right to pose questions to the individuals involved, and it is expected that those individuals respond truthfully. However, SHRs are not obligated to provide evidence to the players who are undergoing an investigation.

Neglecting to report such plagiarism despite being aware can also lead to consequences.
