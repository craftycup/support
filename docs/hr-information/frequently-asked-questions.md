# Frequently Asked Questions

:::info

Here, HRs can find answers to frequently asked questions.

:::

### <font color="#C21807">Am I required to use grammar?</font>
Grammar is always required in all Crafty Cup games and in ban reasons, but it is not mandatory in private servers. Please keep in mind that grammar is not required in the Crafty Cup Discord server.

### <font color="#C21807">When is it appropriate to use the in-game announcement system?</font>
You may use the announcement system to advertise the cafe, to announce a training session, and to announce a shift.

### <font color="#C21807">What should I do if I need to go inactive for over three days?</font>
You are required to create an inactivity notice using Hyra. 

### <font color="#C21807">If I need to go AFK while in-game, what should I do?</font>
If you need to go AFK while in-game, stand against a wall or head to the staff room. If you anticipate being AFK for five or more minutes, you are encouraged to leave the server. Staying AFK for a prolonged period of time will result in a potential punishment.

### <font color="#C21807">If I were to resign or get demoted, can I claim another HR rank again?</font>
Yes, if you were to resign or get demoted, you are permitted to claim another HR rank. Note that you may not claim the same rank more than once.

### <font color="#C21807">How can I hide my commands? Is it mandatory to hide commands?</font>
You can hide your commands in two ways. To execute a command privately using the “/e” method, simply open the chat and enter the command as usual. Once entered, place an “/e” before the desired command to ensure it is hidden. Additionally, to access the console, simply press the “;” or “’” key on your keyboard. This action will display a GUI at the top of your screen. Unlike using commands in the chat, the console does not require a prefix before entering the command. Hiding commands is not required. It is not mandatory to hide commands.

### <font color="#C21807">I opened a ticket, but no one is answering. What should I do?</font>
In most cases, tickets take up to 24 hours before they are solved. Feel free to ping a support staff member if your ticket is not answered within 24 hours.

### <font color="#C21807">What are the HR activity requirements?</font>
In order to avoid being reformed, you must spend at least 90 minutes at the cafe per week. You must also be moderately active in our Discord server. More information can be found in the Activity Requirements and Inactivity Notices section.

### <font color="#C21807">My account has been compromised. What should I do?</font>
In this case, inform an SHR immediately. One will be able to assist you and take action. 

### <font color="#C21807">Can I oversee or supervise at training sessions?</font>
No, HRs can only participate by hosting, co-hosting, or training. SHRs are the only individuals permitted to oversee training sessions. 

### <font color="#C21807">I want to know why someone was blacklisted or permanently banned. Who can check that?</font>
Execute /userinfo in #hr-commands.

### <font color="#C21807">I am unable to attend my scheduled session, so what should I do?</font>
If you are unable to attend your scheduled session, you must find a suitable replacement as soon as possible.

### <font color="#C21807">What is Hyra? Am I required to sign up?</font>
Hyra is an activity tracker that counts the amount of time you spend at the cafe. In order to view this information yourself, you must make an account. However, this is not mandatory. Even if you do not own an account, activity will still be tracked.

### <font color="#C21807">Someone claims to have purchased their rank, but Jupiter did not rank them. What should I do?</font>
Instruct the individual to create a ticket in the Crafty Cup Discord server. Do not rank the player.

### <font color="#C21807">If a player claims to be demoted without reason, what should I do?</font>
If a player claims to have been demoted without a reason, HRs have the ability to investigate the situation by reviewing the demotion reason(s) logged for the LR or MR. This can be done by searching the player's username in Hyra logbook, where demotion logs for LRs and MRs are typically found. It is important to note that most LR demotions are not logged, with the exception of LRs demoted for hinting. In cases where no demotion log is found for the player, it is possible that they have either been blacklisted or permanently banned. To determine if a player is 
blacklisted or permanently banned, HRs can seek assistance from an SHR.
