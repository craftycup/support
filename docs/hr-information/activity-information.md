# Activity Information 

:::info

Here, HRs can find information about activity requirements, inactivity notices, and monthly reforms.

:::


### <font color="#C21807">Activity Requirements</font>
- All HRs are required to spend a minimum of 90 minutes per week or 120 minutes every two weeks at the cafe.
- All HRs are required to attend a reasonable number of training sessions each week.
- All HRs are required to actively engage in conversations in the Discord chats.

To facilitate activity tracking, we use Hyra. If you haven't already, please sign up for Hyra using [this link](https://app.hyra.io/get-started). HRs who lose their minutes on Hyra are encouraged to create a ticket in the Crafty Cup server, making sure to use the format shown in the ticket.


### <font color="#C21807">Inactivity Notices</font>
If an HR is unable to meet an activity requirement or cannot remain active for three or more days, they should create an inactivity notice using Hyra.

__Inactivity Notice Rules:__
- HRs are allowed to have an inactivity notice for a maximum duration of three weeks, and extensions may be granted in genuine cases. 
- All HRs are personally responsible for keeping track of their own inactivity notices.
- During their last day of an inactivity notice, HRs are permitted to claim a spot for themselves to host a session on the following day.
- HRs cannot claim sessions on behalf of other HRs while they are on an inactivity notice.
- During their inactivity notice, HRs can briefly join the game to take a picture, but they are not allowed to join Crafty Cup games for any other reasons.
- HRs are authorized to use Jupiter to rank individuals for shifts or demotions while they are on an inactivity notice.
- If an HR wishes to end their inactivity notice earlier than planned, they can reach out to a Staffing Department member. A Staffing Department member must officially approve the end of an inactivity notice before an HR resumes their duties.
