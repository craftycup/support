:::info

Here, HRs can find the group shouts used for shifts and trainings, as well as important formats.

:::

### <font color="#C21807">Shift Shouts</font>
Hosts must use these group shouts and may not modify them.

`🛍️ [SHIFT] | Hello, everyone! I am now hosting a shift at the cafe. Staff, this is an opportunity for you to get promoted and earn points. Customers, why not head down to the cafe and get a delectable coffee? I look forward to seeing everyone there!`

`🛒 [SHIFT] | The shift has concluded. Congratulations to everyone who was promoted! If you were unable to attend, do not fret, as there will be several more in the future. Why not head down to the cafe and get yourself a luxury milkshake?`

### <font color="#C21807">Training Shouts</font>
Co-Hosts must use the three shouts below and may not modify them. The first shout is the same format announcers must use to announce training sessions in the store.

**Training is Starting:**

**Training is Locked:**

**Training is Concluded:**
