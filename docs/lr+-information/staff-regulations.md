- Always respect other staff members.
- Do not discriminate against anyone's race, sexuality, gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.
- Maintaining professionalism is required when on-duty and off-duty. Staff members are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times, as their behavior directly reflects the reputation of our group.
- Professionalism must be maintained to a certain degree within the Crafty Cup Discord server. Staff members are more than welcome to converse with one another, but all topics must be appropriate and within reason.
- Staff members should not idle in the middle of the cafe, but they will not be punished for doing so. If a staff member needs to go idle or take a break, they should respawn in the staff room by resetting their character. HRs are permitted to stand against a wall while AFK.
- Staff members are prohibited from stealing other workers' tills or cash registers.
- Regardless of who may be at fault in a given situation, staff members are expected to refrain from instigating or participating in any form of drama.
